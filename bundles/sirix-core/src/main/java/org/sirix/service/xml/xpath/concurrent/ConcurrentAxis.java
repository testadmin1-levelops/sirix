/**
 * <h1>ConcurrentAxis</h1>
 * <p>
 * Realizes in combination with the <code>ConurrentAxisHelper</code> the concurrent evaluation of pipeline
 * steps. The given axis is uncoupled from the main thread by embedding it in a Runnable that uses its one
 * transaction and stores all the results to a queue. The ConcurrentAxis gets the computed results from that
 * queue one by one on every hasNext() call and sets the main-transaction to it. As soon as the end of the
 * computed result sequence is reached (marked by the NULL_NODE_KEY), the ConcurrentAxis returns
 * <code>false</code>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This framework is working according to the producer-consumer-principle, where the ConcurrentAxisHelper and
 * its encapsulated axis is the producer and the ConcurrentAxis with its callees is the consumer. This can be
 * used by any class that implements the IAxis interface. Note: Make sure that the used class is thread-safe.
 * </p>

 * <h2>Description</h2>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Filter the node currently selected by the provided transaction.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <h2>Convention</h2>
 * 
 * <p>
 * <ol>
 * <li><strong>Precondition</strong> before each call to <code>IFilter.filter()</code>:
 * <code>IReadTransaction.getKey() == n</code>.</li>
 * <li><strong>Postcondition</strong> after each call to <code>IFilter.filter()</code>:
 * <code>IReadTransaction.getKey() == n</code>.</li>
 * </ol>
 * </p>
 * 
 * <h2>User Example</h2>
 * 
 * <p>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * // hasNext() yields true iff rtx selects an element with local part &quot;foo&quot;.
 * new FilterAxis(new SelfAxis(rtx), new NameFilter(rtx, &quot;foo&quot;));
 * </pre>
 * 
 * </p>
 * 
 * <h2>Developer Example</h2>
 * 
 * <p>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * // Must extend &lt;code&gt;AbstractFilter&lt;/code&gt; and implement &lt;code&gt;IFilter&lt;/code&gt;.
 * public class ExampleFilter extends AbstractFilter implements IFilter {
 * 
 *   public ExampleFilter(final IReadTransaction rtx) {
 *     // Must be called as first.
 *     super(rtx);
 *   }

 *   public final boolean filter() {
 *     // Do not move cursor.
 *     return (getTransaction().isSelected());

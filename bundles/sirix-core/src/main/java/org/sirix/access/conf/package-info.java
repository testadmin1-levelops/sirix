/**
 * <h1>Configuration ofsirix</h1>
 * <p>
 * All configuration of sirix takes place of the classes in this package.
 * <ul>
 * <li>The {@link org.sirix.access.conf.DatabaseConfiguration} defines the settings within a
 * {@link org.sirix.access.Database} (e.g. path to the database and the version where the data was
 * created). This configuration is only needed within the creation of a {@link org.sirix.access.Database}
 * and serialized.</li>
 * <li>The {@link org.sirix.access.conf.ResourceConfiguration} defines the persisted settings within a
 * {@link org.sirix.access.Session} (e.g. versioning-kind of the resource, hashing-kind, ...). This
 * configuration is only needed within the creation of a resource and serialized.</li>
 * <li>The {@link org.sirix.access.conf.SessionConfiguration} defines the runtime settings within a
 * {@link org.sirix.access.Session} (e.g. numbers of transactions, ...). This configuration is needed
 * within each instantiation of a {@link org.sirix.access.Session}.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * All configurations are set within the {@link org.sirix.access.Database} only.

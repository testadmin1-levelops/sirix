                                        <p>Introduction</p>



 



<p>Background: Settled as early as 1000 B. C., Samoa was &quot;discovered&quot; by European explorers in the 18th century. International</p>

<p>rivalries in the latter half of the 19th century were settled by an 1899 treaty in which Germany and the US divided the Samoan</p>

<p>archipelago. The US formally occupied its portion - a smaller group of eastern islands with the excellent harbor of Pago Pago - the</p>

<p>following year. </p>



                                         <p>Geography</p>

<p>April, dry season from May to October; little seasonal temperature variation </p>



<p>Terrain: five volcanic islands with rugged peaks and limited coastal plains, two coral atolls (Rose Island, Swains Island) </p>

<p>funds in the past few years to improve water catchments and pipelines </p>



<p>Geography - note: Pago Pago has one of the best natural deepwater harbors in the South Pacific Ocean, sheltered by shape from</p>

<p>rough seas and protected by peripheral mountains from high winds; strategic location in the South Pacific Ocean </p>

                                          <p>Economy</p>







<p>Economy - overview: This is a traditional Polynesian economy in which more than 90% of the land is communally owned.</p>

<p>Economic activity is strongly linked to the US, with which American Samoa conducts the great bulk of its foreign trade. Tuna fishing</p>

<p>and tuna processing plants are the backbone of the private sector, with canned tuna the primary export. Transfers from the US</p>

<p>Government add substantially to American Samoa's economic well-being. Attempts by the government to develop a larger and</p>

<p>broader economy are restrained by Samoa's remote location, its limited transportation, and its devastating hurricanes. Tourism, a</p>

<p>developing sector, may be held back by the current financial difficulties in East Asia. </p>
